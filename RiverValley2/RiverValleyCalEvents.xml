--++++ INFO ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THAILAND
Thailand is a source, transit, and destination country for human trafficking. It is a destination-side hub of exploitation in the Greater Mekong Sub-region, for both sex and labor exploitation. In Thailand, close to 400,000 children under the age of 16 are believed to be in the sex trade, working in clubs, bars, and brothels. Thailand has been placed on many international “watch lists” because of its status as a well known country for trafficking and a thriving sex industry that draws foreign tourists from all over the world and many times uses trafficked women and children as its “product.”


[url=http://www.samaritancreations.org/][IMG]http://i.imgur.com/dDsOjoY.jpg[/IMG][/url]
Samaritan Creations is an organization in Thailand that exists to rescue, restore, and empower women ensnared by the sex trade in Thailand with the grace and love of God. By offering women an alternative means of income to prostitution they enable them to leave the sex trade and begin a new future for their lives. Samaritan Creations does this through entrepreneurial training and funding of these women for helping them learn the skills needed to not only support themselves, but to return to their communities where they can become positive agents for social change and economic renewal. They currently partner with these women to help them produce a growing variety of products and trade skills that they can use to begin to become financially independent. They also assist the women in building a positive spiritual identity, giving them hope for the future.
