--++ God @ the Box Office

The God @ the Box Office series is aimed at helping us engage popular culture from a Kingdom perspective under Christ's Lord-ship. We will do this not just in theory but with a practical approach that allows us to learn skill and discernment. We will watch numerous films, and think about them Christianly. We will also survey the cultural landscapes of both Hollywood and the Christian community, and address many of the most common questions which arise when evangelicals talk about pop culture. We may not all agree with every conclusion about specific aspects of the movies we see or their impact on our culture, but hopefully you will find even the disagreement helpful. The reason is that we will enter into a conversation rather than listening to someone pontificate like an expert having the final word on the topic. The God @ The Box Office series will help us develop skill in discernment, it will equip us with the correct questions to ask so that we can think and live clearly, deeply, and most important, Christianly.
