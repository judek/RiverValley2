--++ Children's Minstry 

Here at River Valley our goal is to partner with parents as we help children grow in Christ. We believe that children receive Biblical training at church but more importantly within the family. Each week children up to age six are taught a Biblical story and truth. Throughout the morning the Biblical story and truth is reinforced through song and activities. Parents are given informational papers with the Biblical story and truth so they can have opportunity to discuss them with their child through the week.

Children ages seven to twelve are encouraged to worship and fellowship with their parents. It is essential for children to witness their parents praising God and learning His truth. The children receive fun activities along with materials which supplement the pastor's teaching. The children are encouraged to do the activities and materials during the service. Parents are not to worry about their children becoming distractions or disruptions, here at River Valley as a community we embrace children and want them to be a part of our worship service. It is amazing how children listen while "seemingly" distracted. Parents are encouraged to talk with their children about the service. Much learning can take place in the casual discussion of God between parent and child and Sunday morning teaching is a good start.

As your child moves on to the teen years they are encouraged to be an active part of the worship team through scripture reading, praise band, and audio visual technicians.  Youth group is available outside of worship times.
