Thank you for committing to pray for River Valley prayer campaign. Soon you will be receiving emails and mailers detailing opportunities for you to continue to pray for our community. For now, please pray for God's continued direction and wisdom as we search for a new worship space, and intercede on behalf of the staff and leaders of the church that there would be unity in decision making and grace abounding. 

"May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness of Christ."  -2 Thessalonians 3:5
