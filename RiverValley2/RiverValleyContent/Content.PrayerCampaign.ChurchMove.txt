--+++ Church Move

We're getting into planning for this move pretty heavy now and we're wanting the church's focus to be on prayer to keep worry and discontentment from clouding God's vision for the church.

--++++ God's direction for the move:
That He put us where He wants us to work for the city of Aurora

--++++ The Leadership of the church:
That God would keep our minds open to all the possibilities God has and that we would remain focused on the vision of the church

--++++ The Body of River Valley:
That we would all pursue godliness in a time when everyone's gifts are required to build the church

--++++ The outside agencies we're working with:
That the Holy Spirit would work miracles in the hearts and minds of realtors, business owners, and city officials so that we would see miracles.
