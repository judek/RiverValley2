--+++ Worship at River Valley Community Church 

Every Sunday morning at 10am we gather as a body of believers to give praise to God through various forms of physical worship. Romans 12:1 says, "Therefore I urge you brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. "As we are to offer all of ourselves to God, lives lived as worship offerings; we seek to communicate this principle each time we gather for times of praise at River Valley. Through music and other art forms, times in prayer, giving, fellowship, and communion, we desire to humbly offer all of ourselves to God as a community of believers so that individually we would do the same throughout our weeks.
