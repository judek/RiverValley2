--++ Discipleship Life groups

--+++ Life groups are the core of our community

 
Like the church of the First Century, River Valley Life groups meet house-to-house, 
coming together to study God's word, to pray, to evangelize, to serve, and to help one 
another. We use an acronym serve to guide our Life Groups. It breaks down like this:

--++++ SERVE
<ul>
<li>S=Spiritual formation</li>
<li>E=Evangelism</li>
<li>R=Reproduction</li>
<li>V=Volunteerism</li>
<li>E=Extending care</li>
</ul>
                                                     
If you have questions or would like to connect with a Life group,
