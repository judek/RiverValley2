--+++ Ministry at River Valley Community Church 

We believe in connecting here at River Valley. We are a place where you can connect with God, and connect with one another. While our Life groups serve as the primary place of connection and our Sunday morning worship celebrations provide a family-reunion-type of atmosphere where we gather to praise God, River Valley's adult ministries are places of connection that take us into deeper community with God and with one another.
