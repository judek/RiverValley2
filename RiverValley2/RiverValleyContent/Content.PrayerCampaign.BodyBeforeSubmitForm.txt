--++ Prayer Campaigns

At River Valley Community Church we are committed to seeking God's desires first among all things (Matthew 6:25-33), and that requires the collective effort of each individual member of the church body. Whether you're wanting to pray more for the church, your neighbors or your place of business, we want you to be equipped to reach out in all of those areas. Once you sign up we can send you resources and encouragement for continued prayer and outreach, so please check out the campaign requests and consider this commitment. If you have any questions, please feel free to call Eli at 630.844.9115. God bless.
