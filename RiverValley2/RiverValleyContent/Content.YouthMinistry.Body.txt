--++ Youth Minstry 

You are welcome to check out our High School Youth Group, Middle School Youth Group, and our Children's ministry. Each of our ministries are designed to help young men and women develop their basic beliefs and develop a Christian world view.

Our high school and middle school students take advantage of leadership opportunities through service projects throughout the year as well as playing an important role in River Valley's annual Vacation Bible School.

We have partnered with K-Life ministries and Teen Nite Inc. for our high school and middle school ministries. Through these groups, our youths grow into fully developing followers of Jesus Christ through a proven discipleship ministry. 

The River Valley family is sure that you will find your experiences with us to be rich, fulfilling and fun. This is a place where we Live different, Love deeper and Laugh more.
