--++ Prayer and Praise


--+++ Welcome to the River Valley Prayer and Praise Chain! 
 
The River Valley Prayer & Praise Chain is a way that we lift up the concerns and praises of our church family and glorify God.

<ul>
<li>"Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus" (Philippians 4:6-7).</li>
<li>"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9).</li>
<li>"Be joyful always; pray continually; give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus" (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18).</li>
<li>"I desire therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting" (1 Timothy 2:8).</li>
</ul>


--+++ Prayer Band

Our Prayer Band meets every Sunday morning at 9:30am to pray for our worship celebration, our church family, our personal burdens and praises, and whatever else the Holy Spirit places on our hearts. Please feel free to join us at 9:30am every Sunday morning for prayer in the cafateria at Aurora Christian School.
