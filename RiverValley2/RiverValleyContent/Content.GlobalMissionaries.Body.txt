--+++ Peter and Ochie Bangcong
Email: peter-ochie_bangcong@ntm.org
"We, Peter & Ochie Bangcong, are working as church planter missionaries among the Red Karen tribe in Thailand. Our family left the Philippines and came to Thailand as church planters in August 1997. We studied the Thai language for 18 months and after that we moved to the Red Karen Tribe located at the border between Thailand and Burma, and we studied their language and culture because it was our desire that we could teach the Gospel clearly and meaningfully. The Lord is working among them and many Red Karen people have believed our teaching and are saved. Aside from teaching the church the word of God, we at the same time, spent time with five believers of Christ and trained them to be church leaders and Bible teachers. These five men are now teaching their fellow Red Karen people. Just this year, the Gospel was preached to an outreach village and another church was established. We are now working in curriculum development of the church and doing some translation of the portions of the Bible into the Red Karen language."


--+++ Mike & Kay Killar - "Samaritan Creations"
Email: gilsonwu@yahoo.com or samaritancreations@yahoo.com
Samaritan Creations exists to rescue, restore, and empower women by the grace and love of God.  By offering women an alternative income to prostitution we both rescue them from the trap of selling their bodies and empower them to alter the course of their lives.  Through the telling and living out of God’s love, the rescued women are restored to a right relationship with God and others.  Via entrepreneurial training and funding, we empower women to return to their hometowns to plant churches, alter the local economy, and forewarn people of the trap of prostitution.  Samaritan Creations was founded by the Killar’s (Mike & Kay) and the Phomphoung’s (Kong and Sook) in May of 2010.


--+++ Sam Rong Tai Church
Email: gilsonwu@yahoo.com
Sam Rong Tai Church brings a sprout of life to the dreary industrial slum in which it is located.  Led by pastor Charlie, it ministers to an average of 20 adults and 45 kids each weekend.  At this point, it's main focus is on children and teens, as the surrounding community is rampant with drug and alcohol abuse and early teen pregnancy.  With the assistance of River Valley Community Church, Sam Rong Tai recently completed refurbishing their building, ensuring continuing ministry for the foreseeable future.

Our ministry point is in Central Africa, centered in Rwanda.
Why train national pastors?

A.  The Biblical mandate.    This ministry model is rooted in 2 Timothy 2:2  “and what you have heard from me in the presence of many  witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.”   This is a practical discipling and mentoring ministry where TRI-M missionaries and invited adjunct teachers  come along side of those who are called but not trained, providing necessary Biblical and practical training.

B.  The lack of biblical training centers in many third world communities.   In many places where churches have been established there are no adequate local training institutes.  TRI-M presenters come into those communities with detailed theological instruction providing face to face training and mentoring.   In many cases this training material enhances the library of these church leaders in their own language
