--++++ Our Mission
To partner with families and support our community by aiding in the development of children and providing a strong foundation in a faith-based, nurturing, learning environment that supports the growth of the whole child. 

--++++ Our Philosophy
Our Philosophy: To promote school readiness and long-term school success by teaching the whole child across an integration of five areas of development. 

1. Social-Emotional Development: We believe the early years are important to develop self-management skills, social awareness, relationship skills, decision-making skills, and responsible behaviors. 
2. Cognitive Growth Development: We believe that children construct understanding in literacy, numeracy, science, and social studies as they observe, listen, play, explore, investigate, and discover things in their world. 
3. Physical Well-Being and Motor Development: We will promote the general well-being of young children through movement skills, rules and safety during physical activity, team-building activities, as well as fine-motor activities for pre-writing enrichment. 
4. Creative-Arts Development: We believe in the importance of creative expression for young children through music, movement, dramatic play, and visual art as another form of communicating ideas and emotions. 
5. Spiritual Development: We believe in incorporating Christ-like characteristics and solid Biblical principles into daily living, as children develop and discover their own faith and spirituality.
